This plugin allows to share information about installed plugins and software versions via a secure Moodle webservice
endpoint.

TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO


## Configuration and Usage

During installation, the plugin will create two new external services:

- `Plugins fetcher`: This is the primary service that allows you to fetch information about installed plugins and
  software versions.
- `Plugins fetcher (legacy)`: This external service provides a simple and backwards-compatible API for fetching basic
  information about installed plugins.
  - This service is disabled by default and must be enabled manually under _Site Administration > Server > External
    services_.

### Initial setup

To start using the plugin, you need to:

1. Add a new user to the list of _Authorised users_ for the `Plugins fetcher` service under _Site Administration >
   Server > External services_. 
2. Create a new web service token for the assigned user under _Site Administration > Plugins > Web services > Manage
   tokens_.


### API documentation

You can find a full documentation of the API functions under _Site Administration > Server > Web services > API
Documentation_.


#### Example response

The `local_pluginsfetcher_get_info` web service function returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
